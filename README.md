## Project Overview

**GaiGai** is developed under the theme of improving global travel safety and awareness. It is a mobile application designed to enhance traveler safety by providing **real-time local risk insights** and **personal safety monitoring** features. It aims to centralize access to critical safety information such as scam alerts, flood risks, and earthquake warnings. This helps the users to make informed decisions before and during their trips.


## Inspiration & Design

Traveling abroad often comes with safety uncertainties, from local scams to unexpected natural disasters.  While platforms like _Sitata_, _GeoSure_, and _bSafe_ offer partial solutions, **GaiGai** integrates multiple safety aspects into a single and user-friendly platform.

Key design principles:

-   Real-time, location-based safety insights
    
-   Fast access to emergency tools and resources
    
-   Integration with Google Gemini API for intelligent risk assessment
